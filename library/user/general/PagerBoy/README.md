### 🕵️‍♂️ BECOME THE ULTIMATE SECRET AGENT!

**Psst! Hey you!** Yeah, you! Do you want to run secret missions right under everyone's nose?

Meet **PagerBoy**: The ultimate disguise for your WiFi Pineapple Pager. Turns your mobile phone or tablet into a **super-secret command center** that looks just like a retro toy!

While everyone else thinks you're just leveling up your character or playing a game, you're actually running top-secret payloads. It's the perfect cover for field agents who need to hack in plain sight without blowing their cover. **It’s not just a theme... it’s your secret weapon!**

* **DAY & NIGHT MISSIONS:** Switch between the classic "Grey Ghost" look for day missions and the "Stealth Black" mode for night raids.
